                <h3>Food for a Family</h3>
                <p>Food is an important part of a family's diet and provides sustenance for everyone in the household.
                    It
                    can be
                    difficult to find affordable, healthy food that meets all of a family's needs. One way to find
                    affordable,
                    healthy food is to look into food delivery services. These services provide grocery delivery to your
                    home or
                    workplace.</p>

            <div class="shelter">
                <h3>Shelter for Family</h3>
                <p>A family is a vulnerable group, and when one is displaced or homeless, the stress of not knowing
                    where
                    they will next find shelter can be overwhelming. The Family Rescue foundation provides temporary
                    shelter
                    for families in need. They also provide food, clothing, and access to Counseling and Resources.</p>

                <h3>Madicine for family</h3>
                <p>The history of madicine is long and complex, but it has one important element: the provision of
                    practical
                    care for the common person. In the Middle Ages, madicine was a largely self-help practice that aimed
                    to
                    maintain mental and physical health. Today, madicine is a popular form of family care, providing
                    support
                    for parents and children as they face common health challenges.</p>

                <h2>Their lives depend on your donation</h2>
                <p>Donation is important to many people, especially those who rely on donations for their everyday
                    lives.
                    There
                    are many reasons why someone might need money, and a donation can be the perfect way to help.
                    Here
                    are
                    four
                    examples: 1) You may be in need of money because you’re out of work or have a difficult time
                    paying
                    your
                    bills. 2) You may be in need of money to cover costs associated with your illness or injury. 3)
                    You
                    may
                    be
                    in need of money for a special project that you’ve been working on all summer and it’s almost
                    done.
                    4)
                    You
                    may be in need of money to pay for school expenses. If you know someone who needs money, it can
                    give
                    them
                    the power to ask for help without feeling embarrassed or ashamed.</p>
